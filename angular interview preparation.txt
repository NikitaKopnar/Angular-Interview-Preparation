What is angular - Angular is development platform built on Typescript, it a component-based framework for building scalable web application.
It provides multiple online libraries to develop feature like Routing, form management, clieent-server communication.
There are 8 main building blocks of angualar - 
Module	   component	template	metadata	data-binding	directives	services	dependency-injection
Primary use of angular is to develop single-page application, website/web-application is able to rewrite the page with new data received from server.

What are the main feature of angular - 
dependency injection 	Typescript	data-binding	componentes	directives	templates	unit-testing	Routing		Lazy-loading
Modules			high-performance		creating-dynamic components

Explain angular component-based architecture - components are main building block of any angular application.component can be created using 
ng genearte component component-name.which contains mainly 4 files .ts, .html, .spec.ts, .css. 
.ts contains business logic. It also contains @Component decorator under which we have selector, template-url, style to the angular component.
we can render dynamic data using data-bindings,create custom directives,inject services to component

directives in angular - component directive	attribute directive	structural directive	
ngClass - its attribute directive used to apply different style classed to html elements
ngStyle - its attribute directive used to apply inline style
ngFor - its structural directive used to display list contents
ngSwitch - its structural directive used to apply conditinal statement result
ngIf - its structural directive used to eveluate data on conditinal basis.
ngTemplateOutlet - its attribute directive, used to create customizable template
To create custome directive need to use cli command - ng generate directive custome-directive
@Directive decorator used to define seletor of custom directive, to access nativeElement property import ElementRef and inject to the constructor.
to apply custome directive use selector in element.
To handle custome event, import HostListener

Modules in angular - Module in angular contains components, custom directives, pipes, services those are related to application.
ngModule directive is used to define module in angular which is deprecated. Now angular is using standalone application.

data-binding in angular - data binding used to synchronize data between angular component and HTML
string interpolation	property binding	event binding	two-way data binding

Services in angular - service in angular are simply typescript class with @injectable() decorator, using this decorator angular get to know this class
is injectable.
The main objective of service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an angular application.
those are usually implemented through dependency injection.

what are the form in angular - there are 2 main forms in angular - template-driven form - reactive form
Reactive form - Reactive forms explicitely created, its structured, immutable, Synchronous, form validations using functions.
FormGroup - it is collection of form control, used to aggregates the values and statuses of child 'FormControl' instances into one object.
FormControl - Represents a single input field or control in a form, Provides properties and methods to handle the value and validation state.
FormArray - an array of FormControl, FormGroup, FormArray instance.Useful to managing a dynamic number of form controls,
            like an array of addresses or a list of items
FormBuilder - A service that simplifies the creation of form groups and form controls, reduces boilerplate by providing methods like 'group()', 'control()'
             and 'array()'

how does angular handles routing - angular handlles routing using RouterModule, where developer can define router.Navigate between components and manages
manages state during navigation
Router Module - Angular's RouterModule provides necessary services and directives for routing.it needs to be import in main application module
Routes - Routes are defined in a configuration array, where each route maps a URL path to a component,the configuration specifies paths, components,param's
Router Outlet - <router-outlet> directive is placeholder in the template where the routed component will be displayed.This needs to place in main template
Router Link - The [routerLink] directive allows you to navigate different routes using a URL or a path, replacement of traditional <a> tag.
Activated Route - ActivatedRoute service provides access to information about the current route, including URL parameters, query parameters and route data.
Router service - The Route service offers methods to navigate programmatically, get the current route state, and listen to route changes.
